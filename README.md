# CNN-using-CIFAR10-MNIST-datasets

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets. The code is written in Python using the TensorFlow library and includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the training and evaluation of the CNN models. The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, while the MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits in 10 classes. The implementation uses various CNN architectures and techniques such as data augmentation, dropout regularization, and early stopping to achieve high accuracy on the test sets of both datasets.
